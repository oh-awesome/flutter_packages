## local_auth-v3.0.2-ohos-1.0.0

### Added

* Add unit tests for the OHOS plugin
* Version & Environment
Package version upgraded from 3.0.1 to 3.0.2 (both main package and example synchronized);
Dart SDK constraint updated from ^3.9.0 to ^3.10.0, and minimum Flutter version raised from >=3.35.0 to >=3.38.0.

### Fixed


* Documentation Refactoring
Removed legacy README.md / README_CN.md, replaced with README.OpenHarmony.md and README.OpenHarmony_CN.md, which include a complete API table, full property descriptions for OhosAuthMessages, parameter tables for authenticate, and multiple code examples;
Added CHANGELOG.OpenHarmony.md to track all changes.
* Native Code Quality Hardening (AuthenticationHelper.ets & LocalAuthPlugin.ets)
Unified exception handling for all MethodChannel handlers, ensuring that result is always called back exactly once;
Cut off the reference chain: UserAuthInstance → Listener → AuthCallback → MethodResult, fixing the memory leak caused by unreleased listeners/resources after authentication (covering both the start() sync-failure path and the stopAuthentication path);
Changed the global authInProgress flag to a plugin instance field, eliminating state cross-talk under multi-engine scenarios;
Cleaned up redundant fields and dead code in AuthCallback.
* Testing (local_auth_test.dart)
Added four new test groups covering parameter validation, permission/availability errors, edge cases, and concurrency scenarios;
Fixed one assertion mapping error;
All 52 test cases now pass successfully.
